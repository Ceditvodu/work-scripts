# Interesting scripts from my work

1. "Spoiler" - standart spoiler (plain js, oop)
  - it`s writen on plain js, so you dont need no any of modern libraries or fraimworks to make it work;
  - also it describe by next design pattern and will make upgrade more easier:
    - module;
    - controller;
    - prototype;
  - creating different groups with their own class for a couple of elements;
  - change class name for inner elements;
  - choose velocity of sliding for each spoiler group;
  - create a simple automatic fetures;
  - good background for creation more difficult elements bassed on it;
    - spoiler;
    - half content spoiler;
    - accordion.
  - creating half size spoiler;
  - title text changing on toggle;
